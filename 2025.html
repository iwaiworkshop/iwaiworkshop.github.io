			<!-- <h4>Motivation of the workshop</h4> -->
			<p class="mb-0">
				The 6th International Workshop on Active Inference wants to bring together researchers on active
				inference as well as related research fields in order to discuss current trends, novel results and
				real-world applications. We have an interest in exploring the extent to which active inference can be
				used in modern machine learning settings, such as in hybrid setups combining it with deep learning, as
				well as to unify the latest psychological and neurological insights, and to determine how it can best be
				used to understand action, optimization and decision making.
			</p>

			<p class="mb-0">
				IWAI 2025 will focus on three core streams of Active Inference and Bayesian Brain research:

			<ol>
				<li>Computational Theory and Simulations<br />
					- Mathematical and computational developments.
				</li>
				<li>Cognitive, Philosophical, and Neural Models<br />
					- Modeling biological, neural, and cognitive phenomena, and integrating applied philosophy.
				</li>
				<li>Empirical, Clinical, and Real-World Applications<br />
					- Data-driven studies applied to robotics, IoT, clinical, industrial, and societal challenges.
				</li>
			</ol>
			We look forward to your contributions and participation at IWAI 2025! For any questions, please contact us

							<b>Ryan Smith</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							Dr. Smith's lab focuses on understanding the neurocomputational mechanisms underlying
							emotion-cognition interactions and
							how they relate to brain-body interactions, with a special focus on information-seeking
							behavior, prospective planning,
							and interoception. Lab projects also focus on how these mechanisms are affected in
							depression, anxiety, and substance
							use disorders. The primary research methods used in the lab are neuroimaging and
							computational modeling, including a
							wide range of modeling approaches (e.g., drift-diffusion models, reinforcement learning
							models, active inference
							models). A major overarching focus is to characterize information processing differences
							between mentally healthy and
							unhealthy individuals with the goal of improving diagnosis and treatment selection within
							psychiatry and clinical
							psychology.

						<p>
							Chris Mathys is Professor of Cognitive Science at Aarhus University in Denmark. His group's
							research is focused on the creation of computational models of behaviour and brain function,
							with a recent emphasis on
							the modelling of delusions. As a graduate student, Chris developed hierarchical Gaussian
							filtering (HGF), a modelling
							approach that allows for the automatic, principled, and agent-specific adjustment of
							learning rates in rapidly changing
							environments. This enables the quantification of individual differences in learning,
							inference, and decision-making. In
							addition to his original background in physics and information technology, Chris has a
							degree in Psychology and
							Psychopathology and has completed post-graduate training as a clinical psychologist.

						Mahault Albarracin is a Canadian researcher whose work integrates active inference with social
						sciences, particularly
						focusing on gender studies and cognitive science. Affiliated with the Université du Québec à
						Montréal (UQAM), she has
						contributed significantly to understanding complex human behaviors through interdisciplinary
						approaches. Albarracin
						began her academic journey with a Bachelor's degree in Sexology from UQAM (2011-2015), followed
						by a Master of Arts in
						Sexology at the same institution, completed in 2018. Her master's thesis examined the discursive
						intersections of gender
						and sexual fluidity, drawing inspiration from scholars like Judith Butler and Lisa M. Diamond.
						Demonstrating a
						commitment to expanding her expertise, she pursued further education in web development,
						completing bootcamps in React
						and general web development in 2019. Currently, she is undertaking a Doctor of Philosophy in
						Cognitive Computing at
						UQAM, reflecting her dedication to interdisciplinary research.
						Albarracin's research is distinguished by its interdisciplinary nature, merging concepts from
						cognitive science,
						artificial intelligence, and social sciences. She has explored topics such as active inference,
						gender fluidity,
						affordances, and scripts. Her publications in peer-reviewed journals like Frontiers in
						Psychology, Physics of Life
						Reviews, and Entropy demonstrate her commitment to advancing knowledge in these areas. Notably,
						her work on "Epistemic
						Communities under Active Inference" has garnered attention for its insights into the spread of
						ideas within today's news
						ecology.
						Beyond academia, Albarracin has applied her expertise in various professional settings. She has
						held positions such as
						Director of Research Strategies and Ethics Expert at VERSES, a cognitive computing company. Her
						role involves leading
						product innovations and conducting research in computational phenomenology. Additionally, she
						co-founded Sexualis, a
						health tech company aimed at improving accessibility to sexual health services across Quebec.
						Her technological
						proficiency is further evidenced by her experience as a web developer and administrator in
						multiple organizations.

						Ivilin Peev Stoianov is a Senior Researcher at the Institute of Cognitive Sciences and
						Technologies (ISTC, Padova),
						National Research Council (CNR), Italy. With a background in computer science and expertise in
						computational
						linguistics, experimental psychology, and neuroscience, he investigates the algorithmic and
						computational principles
						underlying cognitive functions in humans and primates. His research integrates generative
						probabilistic modeling,
						artificial neural networks, and active inference to study perception, decision-making, and motor
						control from a
						computational perspective. His work advanced theories of Bayesian non-parametric model-based
						reinforcement learning and
						dynamic hybrid active inference, as well as our understanding of the neural and computational
						basis of numerosity
						perception, spatial organization in the hippocampus, predictive spatial coding in the parietal
						cortex, and
						decision-making in the prefrontal cortex. His recent work focuses on hierarchical kinematic
						inference and motor
						planning, embodied decision-making, and predictive coding using continuous, discrete, and deep
						hybrid active inference
						models. Currently he leads a research initiative on the computational basis of motor control and
						decoding of motor
						intentions.
